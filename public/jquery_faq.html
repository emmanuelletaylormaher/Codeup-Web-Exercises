	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions About National Parks</h1>
	<dl>
		<dt>What makes these parks "National"?</dt>
		<dd class="invisible">Every few years, our Reptilian Overlords (Praised Be Cold Bloods) gather together and determine which parks have the most delicious bugs to eat. All National Parks are considered Sacred Ground.</dd>

		<dt>Will the Reptilian Overlords (PBCB) be okay with my warm-blooded self visiting these Sacred Grounds?</dt>
		<dd class="invisible">Of course! We just ask that you wear non-toxic insect repellent and that you DO NOT swat/kill any bugs that come near you.</dd>

		<dt>What happens if I DO kill any bugs?</dt>
		<dd class="invisible">You will no longer be warm-blooded. After some point, you will be cold-blooded like our Masters (PBCB), but in a DIFFERENT way (if you catch my drift).</dd>

		<dt>Can I set-up camp at a National Park?</dt>
		<dd class="invisible">Of course! Be sure to register for a camping/overnight pass whenever you enter.</dd>

		<dt>How old is the National Park System?</dt>
		<dd class="invisible">The National Park Service was created by an act signed by President Woodrow Wilson on August 25, 1916. Yellowstone National Park was established by an act signed by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872, as the nation's first national park.</dd>

		<dt>How many areas are in the National Park System?</dt>
		<dd class="invisible">The system includes 417 areas covering more than 84 million acres in every state, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. These areas include national parks, monuments, battlefields, military parks, historical parks, historic sites, lakeshores, seashores, recreation areas, scenic rivers and trails, and the White House.</dd>

		<dt>Wow, even the White House counts as a National Park?</dt>
		<dd class="invisible">You know it! There's just something about the mosquitos there that really pleases our Overlords (PBCB). It is said that Politician Blood is tasty in the same way that anything cooked with butter just tastes better.</dd>

		<dt>How do I apply for a job with the National Park Service?</dt>
		<dd class="invisible">National Park Services jobs can be applied for online! There is ANOTHER way, however.</dd>

		<dt>Another Way?</dt>
		<dd class="invisible">Yes. It is a way in which you can get into contact with the Alpha Reptile (PBCB, WWARD) directly and involves burying the bones of a mongoose in the ground under the full moon. There are other steps, too, but we'd prefer you contact us for the rest of them if you decide to apply by this route. </dd>

		<dt>How can I contact you?</dt>
		<dd class="invisible">Carrier pigeon.</dd>
